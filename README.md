## Theory :
 The Arduino Uno is powered by the ATmega328P, an 8-bit microcontroller that runs at 16 MHz. It has 32 KB of flash memory, 2 KB of SRAM, and 1 KB of EEPROM. The board 
has 14 digital I/O pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs) and 6 analog input pins. These pins allow the board to interface with various sensors, actuators, and other devices.
The Arduino Uno can be powered via a USB connection or an external power supply. The board has a built-in voltage regulator to manage power from 7 to 12 volts.
The board is programmable using the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), which supports a simplified version of C/C++. The code, known as a "sketch," is uploaded to the board via a USB connection. The Uno has a USB-B port, which is used for communication with a computer. The USB connection also powers the board when connected. The board includes a reset button that restarts the microcontroller, useful during programming and troubleshooting. The In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP) header allows for low-level programming of the microcontroller or firmware updates. The Uno has a built-in LED on pin 13, commonly used for simple tests and debugging.

Procedure:
Step 1: Set Up the Tinkercad Environment
3.	Log in to Tinkercad: Open Tinkercad in your web browser and log in to your account.
4.	Create a New Circuit: In the Tinkercad dashboard, click on "Circuits" and then select "Create New Circuit."
Step 2: Add Components to the Circuit
6.	Arduino Uno: Drag an Arduino Uno board from the components panel onto the workspace.
7.	Gas Sensor: Search for the TMP36 sensor in the components panel and drag it into the workspace.
8.	Breadboard: Drag a small breadboard to the workspace to help with wiring connections.
9.	Resistor (Optional): A resistor may not be necessary for this simple setup, but you can include it for more accurate readings.
10.	Wires: Use wires to connect the components.
Step 3: Connect the MQ-2 Gas Sensor to Arduino:
•	MQ-2 Pins:
o	VCC: Connect this pin to the Arduino 5V pin.
o	GND: Connect this pin to the Arduino GND pin.
o	Analog Output (A0): Connect this pin to an analog input pin on the Arduino (e.g., A0).
o	Digital Output (D0): (Optional) Connect this pin to a digital input pin on the Arduino if you want to use the sensor’s digital threshold output.
Breadboard Wiring:
•	MQ-2 VCC to Arduino 5V: Use a wire to connect the VCC pin of the MQ-2 sensor to the 5V rail on the breadboard (which is connected to Arduino 5V).
•	MQ-2 GND to Arduino GND: Connect the GND pin of the MQ-2 sensor to the ground rail on the breadboard (connected to Arduino GND).
•	MQ-2 Analog Output (A0) to Arduino Analog Pin (A0): Connect the analog output pin of the sensor to Arduino’s A0 pin.
•	(Optional) MQ-2 Digital Output (D0) to Arduino Digital Pin (e.g., D2): Connect the digital output pin if you want to detect gas concentration threshold digitally.
Step 4: Write the Arduino Code
•	Code Editor: Click on the "Code" button at the top of the Tinkercad workspace to open the code editor.
•	Set the Coding Mode: Ensure the editor is in "Text" mode to write your code in C/C++.
•	Enter the Code: Write the following code from the MQ-2  sensor
Step 5: Simulate the Circuit
•	Start Simulation: Click the "Start Simulation" button at the top of the workspace to run the circuit and code.
•	Monitor Output: Open the serial monitor by clicking the "Serial Monitor" button to view the temperature readings in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Step 6: Troubleshoot and Refine
•	Check Connections: Ensure that all connections are made correctly on the breadboard and the Arduino.
•	Adjust Code: If needed, tweak the code to improve accuracy or change the format of the output.
Step 7: Save Your Work
•	Stop Simulation: Click "Stop Simulation" to end the simulation.
•	Save the Circuit: Click "Save" to keep your circuit design and code for future use.

## Program:
```
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
// initialize the library with the numbers of the interface pins
LiquidCrystal lcd(12, 11, 5, 4, 3, 2);
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // set up the LCD's number of columns and rows:
  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(7,OUTPUT);
  pinMode(6,OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  int gas_data;
  gas_data = analogRead(A0);
  lcd.setCursor(00,00);
  lcd.print("Gas :");
  lcd.setCursor(6,00);
  lcd.print(gas_data);
  if(gas_data > 800){
  	digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
    delay(100);
    digitalWrite(13,LOW);
    lcd.setCursor(00,1);
    lcd.print("DANGER");
  }else if(gas_data > 700){
    digitalWrite(6,HIGH);
  	delay(100);
    digitalWrite(6,LOW);
    lcd.setCursor(00,1);
    lcd.print("WARNING");
  }else {
    digitalWrite(7,HIGH);
    lcd.setCursor(00,1);
    lcd.print("SAFE");
  }
  Serial.println(gas_data);
  delay(100);
  lcd.clear();
}
```
